# Building
1. To build this solution you should have Visual Studio 2019.

2. Download project files or clone them, then wait untill all nuget packages will be installed.

If VS19 doesn't install nuget packages automatically, just go to **Project -> Manage NuGet packages** and click **Restore** button.
(This project have some unused/almost unused nuget packages installed, i will clean all this someday)

You also can get **LibVLCSharp.Shared.VLCException**, in that case just Clean project and rebuild it.
